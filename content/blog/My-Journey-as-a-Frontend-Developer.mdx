## First Step - Discovering My Passion for Development

Six years ago, I spent a year alone in the UK, which became my first experience stepping outside my comfort zone and truly learning about myself. Though sometimes lonely and mentally exhausting, this period gave me the space to seriously contemplate my future path. It was during this time that I first discovered the software development profession.

What captivated me about development wasn't just solving given problems, but actively identifying issues and taking initiative to resolve them. The joy I felt when first outputting 'hello world' after learning HTML remains vivid in my memory. Hours would fly by as I wrestled with questions like "Why isn't this working?" or "Why does this work?" While immersed in various projects, I eventually found myself starting a career as a frontend developer.

My professional journey began at Git Company, which operated two e-commerce services. Working there allowed me to witness the entire process of how products reach consumers from production. As the first frontend developer on the team, I was immediately assigned to migrate a dog products e-commerce platform with 10,000+ users from WordPress to React to improve UI flexibility and rendering speed.

Despite the tight schedule, the thrill of problem-solving kept me motivated. When facing unsolved bugs, I would continue thinking about them on my commute home or in the shower, immediately testing new ideas on my laptop when inspiration struck. The exhilaration I felt when solving these issues became my driving force through challenging deadlines.

The tangible results were incredibly rewarding - seeing my code deployed to production, improving overall web speed by 1.5 seconds, and contributing to a 20% increase in user engagement through enhanced UI. These measurable outcomes made me feel invested in the product's success and eager to contribute more.

This sense of ownership motivated me to consider how I could further improve the product. Our development team began documenting and sharing information about different features and implemented regular code reviews to enhance development stability. The company used Slack for team communications, allowing me to observe and actively contribute to discussions across different departments. Thanks to everyone's collaborative efforts, our lifestyle service platform achieved a milestone of 10 million sales in a short period.

Managing two services and migrating a project was overwhelming for a junior developer, but the journey of finding solutions to each challenge enabled tremendous growth. Sometimes I spent days seeking answers in development communities or consulting with friends, but ultimately learned that with persistence, there's always a solution in development.

## Faced Burnout - Overcoming Professional Exhaustion

After gaining about eight months of experience at my first company, I had the opportunity to move to a larger organization. My first team there was a studio developing a new social casino game, where I was responsible for both backend and frontend development for the admin dashboard. Working with an unfamiliar domain and new backend technologies like Java and Spring Boot presented a significant challenge.

Without time to enjoy the excitement of a new job, I immediately began building features from scratch to meet tight deadlines. Despite working late every night, I found satisfaction in being part of creating a new product and discussing code details with team members - filling a gap I had felt at my first company. While my first role involved finding solutions independently, here I could collaborate with others.

After several months, as I became more comfortable with the work, I gained valuable insights about the importance of architecture and algorithms that I hadn't fully appreciated when focusing solely on frontend development. I learned how to design projects for high-traffic scenarios using microservice architecture, understanding how different services communicate while maintaining independence and sustainability.

I also experienced firsthand the importance of algorithm design when preparing APIs to handle complex calculations from numerous simultaneous user requests. These principles applied not just to backend development but to the entire product creation process. I constantly considered what architecture would create a maintainable product while enhancing user experience. Working on both backend and frontend gave me a comprehensive understanding of the web development cycle.

Perhaps because I had been working non-stop since beginning my career, burnout hit once I adapted to my role. I felt listless about everything, losing my passion and hunger for learning new things. During this time, I started learning to swim. Spending an hour swimming before work cleared my mind completely. Focusing solely on breathing, kicking, and arm movements helped me overcome burnout by forcing me to let go of work-related thoughts. I noticed improvements not only in physical fitness but also in mental health. This experience taught me the critical importance of work-life balance for sustaining a long-term career.

## Connecting the Dots - The Value of Experience

I love Steve Jobs' expression "connecting the dots" from his Stanford University commencement speech. It conveys the idea that all past experiences shape who we are today, encouraging us to live each moment fully. This concept perfectly applies to my four-year development journey.

My first project migrating from WordPress to React taught me about the complexities of technology transitions and the challenges of managing legacy systems. In subsequent projects, I prioritized code quality, scalability, and maintainability in architectural design. Working as the lone frontend developer cultivated my ability to solve problems independently, which later translated into proactively supporting teammates when working in larger groups.

The process of overcoming burnout helped me recognize the importance of sustainable living. Not only did it restore my passion for life, but finding a healthy outlet through swimming gave me a sense of pride in reclaiming my mental health.

Through these four years of development work, countless choices and experiences have shaped who I am today. Now, I'm ready to step outside my comfort zone again to gain new experiences and continue my evolution as a developer.

## Growth Zone - My Aspirations in the UK

I've always been curious about what it would be like to build products with people from diverse backgrounds. This curiosity has led me to choose the UK for the next stage of my development career. This decision represents more than a geographical move; it's a recalibration of my growth trajectory as a developer.

My experiences - from solving problems alone at my first company, working in teams at my second job, and overcoming burnout - have all contributed to shaping who I am today. Now is the time to challenge myself in a global technology environment, competing and learning to develop a broader perspective.

The UK tech ecosystem offers different cultural approaches and methodologies compared to Korea. Working in this environment and collaborating with developers from varied backgrounds will add new dimensions not only to my technical capabilities but also to my problem-solving approaches.

In the UK, I'm particularly passionate about contributing to scalable systems that enhance user experiences. My experience with React migrations and performance optimization has shown me the tangible impact that well-designed frontend architectures can have on user engagement and business metrics. I'm eager to apply these learnings to new challenges, helping teams build maintainable codebases that can evolve with changing user needs while delivering exceptional performance.

I believe this experience will strengthen my identity as a global developer and, in the long term, help me develop the flexibility to adapt and contribute in any environment. While this decision involves taking the risk of leaving a stable position in the short term, it's a necessary challenge when considering my long-term growth as a developer. As Steve Jobs suggested, I look forward to seeing how this choice will meaningfully connect with my past experiences when I look back in the future.
