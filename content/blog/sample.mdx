# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using **MDX** with Next.js.

## Code Example

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting("World"));
```

## Using Components in MDX

You can use React components directly in your MDX files:

<div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 my-4 rounded-lg">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This is a custom component inside MDX!
</div>

## Lists Work Too

Here are some features of MDX:

- Write JSX directly in markdown
- Import and use React components
- Apply styling with Tailwind classes
- Create dynamic content

## Images

You can also include images:
